# House Price Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques

**House Price Prediction:** Analyzing factors and building models to foster informed decisions in real estate. This project is part of the Statistical Learning Course at the University of Padova.

## Overview
House pricing is a critical aspect with profound impacts on individuals, families, and the broader economy. The decision to purchase a house represents a significant financial milestone, often constituting a substantial portion of one's wealth. Fluctuations in house prices directly influence personal financial stability and the ability to build assets. Furthermore, the real estate market, driven by house prices, plays a pivotal role in economic activity, encompassing property sales, construction, and associated industries.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust model for predicting house prices. This goal is crucial, considering the large number of individuals and families who buy houses every year. Housing affordability is a pressing issue, and precise prediction models can play a pivotal role in addressing it. By meticulously analyzing market trends and evaluating property values, our model seeks to provide valuable insights for individuals, sellers, and industry professionals, empowering them to make well-informed decisions. This project contributes to the understanding of housing market dynamics, aids in financial planning, and promotes fairness and transparency in the real estate sector.

## Objectives
Through our project, our primary objectives are as follows:

1. Illuminate the key factors that influence house prices.
2. Discern the most impactful among these factors.
3. Formulate an effective estimation framework for predicting the price of a house based on its specific characteristics.
